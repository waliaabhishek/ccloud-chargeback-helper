# API Reference

Base URL: `http://localhost:8080` (configurable via `api.host` and `api.port`)

All endpoints except `/health` are prefixed with `/api/v1`.

## General behavior

- **Authentication:** None built-in. Use a reverse proxy for auth.
- **CORS:** Configurable via `api.enable_cors` and `api.cors_origins`. Allowed methods: GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE.
- **Request timeout:** Requests exceeding `api.request_timeout_seconds` (default 30, max 300) return HTTP 504.
- **Content type:** JSON for API data. Export and Preview artifact endpoints
  return their declared CSV or manifest media type.

### Pagination

List endpoints accept:

| Parameter | Type | Default | Constraints |
|---|---|---|---|
| `page` | int | 1 | >= 1 |
| `page_size` | int | 100 | 1–1000 |

Response includes: `items`, `total`, `page`, `page_size`, `pages`.

### Date range defaults

When `start_date` / `end_date` are omitted on list endpoints, the API uses the
tenant's configured lookback window. FOCUS Mapping Preview requires both dates.

### Error responses

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 400 | Invalid parameters (bad filter, unknown column, etc.) |
| 404 | Tenant or resource not found |
| 409 | Pipeline already running (trigger endpoint) |
| 504 | Request timeout |

## Health & Readiness

### `GET /health`

Lightweight liveness check.

**Response:** `{"status": "ok", "version": "<version>"}`

### `GET /api/v1/readiness`

Per-tenant readiness with pipeline state. TTL-cached for 2 seconds.

**Response fields:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `status` | string | `ready`, `initializing`, `no_data`, or `error` |
| `version` | string | Package version |
| `mode` | string | Run mode (`api`, `worker`, `both`) |
| `tenants` | list | Per-tenant status (see below) |

**Per-tenant fields:** `tenant_name`, `tables_ready`, `has_data`,
`pipeline_running`, `pipeline_stage`, `pipeline_current_date`,
`last_run_status`, `last_run_at`, `permanent_failure`,
`topic_attribution_status`, `topic_attribution_error`,
`focus_preview_state`, `focus_preview_completed_repair_dates`,
`focus_preview_total_repair_dates`, `focus_preview_message`,
`focus_preview_ordinary_retention`, and
`focus_preview_evidence_retention`.

`topic_attribution_status` is one of `"disabled"` | `"enabled"` | `"config_error"`. `topic_attribution_error` is a string describing the validation failure when `topic_attribution_status` is `"config_error"`, otherwise null.

`focus_preview_state` is one of `disabled`, `ready`, `upgrading`, `degraded`,
or `unavailable`:

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `disabled` | The tenant does not enable FOCUS Mapping Preview. Progress is null. |
| `ready` | Preview is available and no repair or retention cause needs attention. Progress is null before the first repair and total/total after a successful repair. |
| `upgrading` | A historical repair is queued or running. Existing valid Preview data remains available. |
| `degraded` | Historical repair or retention cleanup needs attention. Existing valid Preview data remains available; use the repair progress and structured retention outcomes to choose the operator action. |
| `unavailable` | Preview readiness cannot be determined safely, including unavailable Preview storage. Progress is null. |

When repair work exists, the completed and total fields report **Date
progress**. A completed date is durably terminal, whether it succeeded or
failed. The ratio is lifecycle progress, not data volume or successful-row
progress.

The two retention fields report the latest recorded attempt independently:

| Field | Cleanup represented |
|---|---|
| `focus_preview_ordinary_retention` | Ordinary tenant pipeline and configured overlay retention |
| `focus_preview_evidence_retention` | Preview source, readiness, allocation-lineage, and organization-authority retention |

Each field is null before an outcome is available. Otherwise it contains
`attempted_at`, `status` (`success` or `failure`), and `diagnostic`. A successful
outcome has a null diagnostic. A failure includes a stable `code`, an
operator-facing `message`, and a redacted `error_type`. A later successful
attempt replaces only the matching cleanup outcome and clears its diagnostic;
the other cleanup outcome and historical repair progress remain independent.
Any recorded retention failure makes Preview `degraded`, including while a
repair is queued, running, or already degraded.

Preview state does not change top-level application readiness or disable
unrelated billing, chargeback, inventory, and pipeline operations. Existing
valid Preview packages and revisions remain available while retention cleanup
needs attention.

## Tenants

### `GET /api/v1/tenants`

List all configured tenants with summary pipeline state.

**Response fields per tenant:** `tenant_name`, `tenant_id`, `ecosystem`, `dates_pending`, `dates_calculated`, `last_calculated_date`, `topic_attribution_status`, `topic_attribution_error`.

`topic_attribution_status` is one of `"disabled"` | `"enabled"` | `"config_error"`. See `GET /api/v1/readiness` above for field semantics.

### `GET /api/v1/tenants/{tenant_name}/status`

Detailed per-date pipeline state for a tenant.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `start_date` | date | no | Filter from this date |
| `end_date` | date | no | Filter to this date |

**Response:** `{tenant_name, tenant_id, ecosystem, topic_attribution_status, topic_attribution_error, states}` where `states` is a list of `{tracking_date, billing_gathered, resources_gathered, chargeback_calculated, topic_overlay_gathered, topic_attribution_calculated}` per date. The `topic_overlay_gathered` and `topic_attribution_calculated` fields are `false` when topic attribution is disabled or in `config_error` state.

### `POST /api/v1/tenants/{tenant_name}/resource-links/resolve`

Look up resource and identity metadata for identifiers within a tenant.
The request body is:

```json
{"identifiers":["env-a","lkc-a","user-a"]}
```

`identifiers` must contain 1–100 non-blank strings. The limit is checked before
duplicate values are removed. Results are scoped to the named tenant and use
two minimal maps:

```json
{
  "resources": {
    "lkc-a": {
      "resource_type": "kafka_cluster",
      "parent_id": "env-a",
      "kafka_cluster_id": null
    }
  },
  "identities": {
    "user-a": {"identity_type": "user"}
  }
}
```

Unknown and deleted identifiers are omitted. Resource entries contain only
`resource_type`, `parent_id`, and `kafka_cluster_id`; identity entries contain
only `identity_type`. A matching identifier may appear in both maps.

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 200 | Maps of active resource and identity matches; missing matches are omitted |
| 422 | Malformed JSON; missing body or `identifiers`; a non-object top-level body; non-string, blank, empty, or more than 100 identifiers |
| 404 | The tenant is not configured |
| 503 | The storage backend provider is unavailable |
| 500 | Unexpected application or backend failure: `{"detail":"Internal server error","error_id":"<uuid>"}` |

## Billing

### `GET /api/v1/tenants/{tenant_name}/billing`

List raw billing line items. Paginated.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `start_date` | date | no | Filter start |
| `end_date` | date | no | Filter end |
| `timezone` | string | no | IANA timezone for date boundaries (e.g. `America/Denver`). Defaults to UTC. |
| `product_type` | string | no | Filter by product type |
| `resource_id` | string | no | Filter by resource |

**Response fields per item:** `ecosystem`, `tenant_id`, `timestamp`, `resource_id`, `product_category`, `product_type`, `quantity`, `unit_price`, `total_cost`, `currency`, `granularity`, `metadata`.

---

## Chargebacks

### `GET /api/v1/tenants/{tenant_name}/chargebacks`

List allocated chargeback rows. Paginated.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `start_date` | date | no | Filter start |
| `end_date` | date | no | Filter end |
| `timezone` | string | no | IANA timezone for date boundaries (e.g. `America/Denver`). Defaults to UTC. |
| `identity_id` | string | no | Filter by identity |
| `product_type` | string | no | Filter by product type |
| `resource_id` | string | no | Filter by resource |
| `cost_type` | string | no | Filter by cost type |
| `tag_key` | string | no | Filter by tag key |
| `tag_value` | string | no | Filter by tag value (requires tag_key) |

**Response fields per item:** `dimension_id`, `ecosystem`, `tenant_id`, `timestamp`, `resource_id`, `product_category`, `product_type`, `identity_id`, `cost_type`, `amount`, `allocation_method`, `allocation_detail`, `tags`, `metadata`.

`tags` is a `dict[str, str]` mapping tag keys to tag values (e.g. `{"team": "platform", "env": "prod"}`). Tags are resolved at query time from the linked resource or identity.

### `GET /api/v1/tenants/{tenant_name}/chargebacks/{dimension_id}`

Get a single chargeback dimension.

**Response:** Dimension fields (tags not resolved at this level — use `/chargebacks` list endpoint for tag-enriched rows).

### `GET /api/v1/tenants/{tenant_name}/chargebacks/dates`

List all distinct dates with chargeback data.

**Response:** `{"dates": ["2026-01-01", "2026-01-02", ...]}`

### `GET /api/v1/tenants/{tenant_name}/chargebacks/allocation-issues`

Aggregated view of failed or problematic allocations. Paginated. Same filters as chargebacks list.

**Response fields per item:** `ecosystem`, `resource_id`, `product_type`, `identity_id`, `allocation_detail`, `row_count`, `usage_cost`, `shared_cost`, `total_cost`.

---

### Compare two cost periods

The comparison endpoints return a ranked view of one source across two explicit
inclusive date ranges. They do not combine chargeback and Topic Attribution
amounts.

```text
GET /api/v1/tenants/{tenant_name}/chargebacks/comparison
GET /api/v1/tenants/{tenant_name}/topic-attributions/comparison
```

The `chargebacks` route reports **Chargeback — allocated tenant costs**. It can
group by `principal` (`identity_id`), `resource` (`resource_id`), or
`environment` (`environment_id`). Its filters are `identity_id`,
`product_type`, `resource_id`, `cost_type` (`usage` or `shared`), `tag_key`,
and `tag_value`.

The `topic-attributions` route reports **Topic Attribution — attributed Kafka
costs, not the full tenant bill**. It can group by `topic` (a stable,
cluster-scoped topic key with cluster and topic display fields) or `cluster`
(`cluster_resource_id`). Its filters are `cluster_resource_id`, `topic_name`,
`product_type`, `attribution_method`, `tag_key`, and `tag_value`.

Topic Attribution's `cluster_resource_id` and `topic_name` filters retain the
existing list behavior and match containing values. Other source filter values
are passed as exact values. Tag keys must start with an alphanumeric character,
then contain only alphanumerics, `_`, or `-`, with a maximum length of 63.

#### Query parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default / constraints |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `baseline_start` | date | yes | Inclusive baseline date. |
| `baseline_end` | date | yes | Inclusive baseline date. |
| `comparison_start` | date | yes | Inclusive comparison date. |
| `comparison_end` | date | yes | Inclusive comparison date. |
| `timezone` | string | no | IANA timezone for date boundaries; `UTC` when omitted. |
| `group_by` | string | no | `principal`, `resource`, or `environment` for chargeback; `topic` or `cluster` for Topic Attribution. Defaults to `principal` or `topic`. |
| `movement` | string | no | `all`, `increase`, or `decrease`; defaults to `all`. Zero changes appear only with `all`. |
| `sort_by` | string | no | `absolute_change`, `entity`, `baseline_amount`, `comparison_amount`, `change`, or `percentage_change`; defaults to `absolute_change`. |
| `sort_direction` | string | no | `asc` or `desc`; defaults to `desc`. |
| `limit` | integer | no | Defaults to `100`; must be between `1` and `500`. |
| source filters | string | no | See the source lists above. `tag_value` requires `tag_key`. |

The Compare control offers row limits of 25, 50, 100, 250, and 500; API
clients may request any value from 1 through 500.

The default order is absolute change descending, with the stable group key as
the final ascending tie-breaker. Alternate sort fields use the same stable
tie-breaker.

The API always receives the four dates explicitly. The Compare controls provide
these presets for hourly and daily tenants:

- **Previous day:** the day before yesterday as the baseline versus yesterday as
  the comparison.
- **Previous week:** the prior Monday–Sunday week as the baseline versus the
  latest completed Monday–Sunday week as the comparison.
- **Calendar month:** the preceding complete calendar month as the baseline
  versus the latest completed calendar month as the comparison.
- **Custom:** two non-empty inclusive date ranges.

Named presets use the current calendar date in the selected IANA timezone. A
timezone change recomputes a named preset and resolves custom dates at local
midnight. The response shows the requested dates and the effective UTC bounds;
daylight-saving changes can make two date ranges have different elapsed
durations.

For monthly tenants, Compare uses `UTC`, offers Calendar month and Custom, and
disables Previous day and Previous week. A custom monthly range must start on
the first day of a UTC month and end on the last day of a UTC month. The API
rejects a non-UTC timezone and partial UTC calendar months.

#### Response

Every monetary amount below is a JSON decimal string, including zero, negative
values, and long fractional values. A non-null `percentage_change` is also a
JSON decimal string; `percentage_change` may be `null` when the baseline is
zero.

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `source` | `chargeback` or `topic_attribution`. |
| `granularity` | Tenant data granularity: `hourly`, `daily`, or `monthly`. |
| `group_by` | The source-specific grouping used for the rows. |
| `timezone` | The effective comparison timezone; monthly responses use `UTC`. |
| `coverage_evaluated_at` | ISO 8601 UTC instant at which coverage was evaluated. |
| `baseline`, `comparison` | Period objects described below. |
| `unequal_durations` | `true` when the two resolved UTC durations differ. It does not reject or normalize the periods. |
| `summary` | Full filtered-scope totals and movement values, independent of `movement` and `limit`. |
| `reconciliation` | Counts and financial contributions for returned, movement-excluded, and top-N-omitted groups. |
| `rows` | At most `limit` groups in the requested server-side order. |

Each period contains `start_date`, `end_date`, `start_at`, `end_at`,
`duration_seconds`, and `coverage`. `start_date` and `end_date` are the
requested inclusive dates. `start_at` is the resolved UTC inclusive bound and
`end_at` is the resolved UTC exclusive bound; both are ISO 8601 UTC datetimes.

`coverage` contains:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `status` | `complete`, `incomplete`, or `unknown`. |
| `expected_dates` | Source dates expected for the period's granularity. |
| `unknown_dates` | Dates whose source availability cannot be confirmed. |
| `incomplete_dates` | Dates without complete source processing evidence. |
| `retention_qualified_dates` | Dates where current evidence cannot distinguish unavailable retained data from a valid zero. This does not assert that data was deleted. |
| `availability_cutoff_at` | The captured source retention cutoff, or `null` when a valid Topic Attribution policy cannot be proven from tenant settings. |

`unknown` takes precedence when both unknown and incomplete dates exist. A
successful chargeback calculation can confirm a zero total even when no rows
match the filters. Topic Attribution requires unfiltered source-date evidence
for the selected slots, so a filtered zero or an empty source slot remains
qualified when that evidence is absent. The UI labels values from either
non-complete period as observed totals and shows the affected dates.

`summary` contains `baseline_amount`, `comparison_amount`, `increases`,
`decreases`, `net_change`, and `percentage_change`. `increases` is the sum of
positive row changes; `decreases` is the signed sum of negative row changes;
`net_change` is the comparison total minus the baseline total. When the
baseline total is exactly zero, `percentage_change` is `null`; the same rule
applies to a row whose baseline amount is zero.

Each row contains `key`, `kind`, `dimensions`, `baseline_amount`,
`comparison_amount`, `change`, `percentage_change`, `baseline_row_count`,
`comparison_row_count`, and `observed_presence`. Presence is based on row
presence, so a zero-valued row is retained. A row absent from a complete period
can be described as cost only in the other period; an absent period with
incomplete or unknown coverage is described as no cost observed.

`reconciliation` contains `full_group_count`, `selected_group_count`,
`returned_group_count`, `movement_excluded_group_count`, and
`row_limit_omitted_group_count`, plus baseline, comparison, and net amounts for
each of the returned, movement-excluded, and row-limit-omitted groups. The
amounts satisfy these identities independently for baseline, comparison, and
net values:

```text
full = returned + movement_excluded + row_limit_omitted
selected = returned + row_limit_omitted
```

A group count remains meaningful even when the corresponding omitted amounts
cancel to zero. Unassigned and sentinel groups are included in these counts,
but do not expose an investigation action.

#### Errors

| Condition | Status and response |
|---|---|
| Invalid date syntax, enum, source grouping, or `limit` bounds | `422`; FastAPI places the offending field at `detail[0].loc = ["query", "<field>"]`. |
| Baseline or comparison start after its end | `400`, respectively `baseline_start must be <= baseline_end` or `comparison_start must be <= comparison_end`. |
| `tag_value` without `tag_key` | `400`, `tag_value requires tag_key`. |
| Invalid tag key format | `400`, `Invalid tag key format: '<key>'`. |
| Unknown IANA timezone | `400`, `Unknown timezone: '<timezone>'`. |
| Monthly request with a non-UTC timezone | `400`, `timezone must be UTC for monthly comparison data`. |
| Monthly baseline is not a complete UTC calendar-month range | `400`, `baseline period must contain complete UTC calendar months for monthly comparison data`. |
| Monthly comparison is not a complete UTC calendar-month range | `400`, `comparison period must contain complete UTC calendar months for monthly comparison data`. |
| Tenant is not configured | `404`, `Tenant '<name>' not found`. |
| Provider wiring is unavailable | `503`, `Storage backend provider is unavailable`. |
| Leased backend cannot provide a consistent comparison read | `503`, `Storage backend does not support consistent comparison reads`. |
| Provider initialization or another unhandled comparison failure | `500`, `{"detail":"Internal server error","error_id":"<uuid>"}`. |
| Request exceeds the configured API timeout | `504`, `Request exceeded <seconds>s timeout`. |

Malformed query input is rejected before settings or storage work. For valid
queries, date-order checks run before the tag dependency, timezone validation,
and monthly alignment checks. Provider initialization failures keep the normal
sanitized 500 response; qualified 200 results are possible only after storage
has been acquired successfully.

## Aggregation

### `GET /api/v1/tenants/{tenant_name}/chargebacks/aggregate`

Multi-dimensional aggregation with time bucketing. Returns up to 10,000 buckets.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `group_by` | list[string] | `["identity_id"]` | Columns or tag keys to group by (repeatable). Use `tag:{key}` for tag-based grouping. |
| `time_bucket` | string | `day` | `hour`, `day`, `week`, or `month` |
| `start_date` | date | no | Filter start |
| `end_date` | date | no | Filter end |
| `timezone` | string | no | IANA timezone for date boundaries (e.g. `America/Denver`). Defaults to UTC. |
| `identity_id` | string | no | Filter by identity |
| `product_type` | string | no | Filter by product type |
| `resource_id` | string | no | Filter by resource |
| `cost_type` | string | no | Filter by cost type |
| `tag:{key}` | string | no | Filter to rows where the tag `{key}` matches the given value. Repeatable for AND semantics. Comma-separated values in a single param are OR-matched. |

**Valid `group_by` columns:** `identity_id`, `resource_id`, `product_type`, `product_category`, `cost_type`, `allocation_method`, `environment_id`.

**Tag-based grouping (`group_by=tag:{key}`):**

Use `tag:` prefix to group by an entity tag key instead of a dimension column. Examples:

- `group_by=tag:owner` — group by the `owner` tag; rows with no `owner` tag land in an `UNTAGGED` bucket.
- `group_by=tag:owner&group_by=tag:department` — group by two tag keys; each bucket has both keys in `dimensions`.
- `group_by=tag:owner&group_by=product_type` — mix tag and dimension grouping in one query.

Tag values are resolved by joining the `entity_tags` table. When a resource and its linked identity both carry the same tag key, the **resource tag wins** (mirrors the behavior on the list endpoint).

**Tag-based filtering (`tag:{key}={value}`):**

Dynamic query parameters prefixed `tag:` are treated as tag filters and are independent of `group_by`.

- `tag:department=eng` — only rows where `department` tag equals `eng`.
- `tag:team=platform,commerce` — `team` IN (`platform`, `commerce`) — comma-separated values are OR-matched within one key.
- `tag:owner=alice&tag:department=eng` — multiple tag params are AND-matched across keys.
- Untagged rows (no matching tag key) are excluded from filtered results.

Tag key format: must start with an alphanumeric character, then alphanumeric, `_`, or `-`, up to 63 characters total. Invalid keys return HTTP 400.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "buckets": [
    {
      "dimensions": {"tag:owner": "team-commerce", "product_type": "kafka"},
      "time_bucket": "2026-01-01",
      "total_amount": "150.00",
      "usage_amount": "120.00",
      "shared_amount": "30.00",
      "row_count": 42
    },
    {
      "dimensions": {"tag:owner": "UNTAGGED", "product_type": "kafka"},
      "time_bucket": "2026-01-01",
      "total_amount": "30.00",
      "usage_amount": "30.00",
      "shared_amount": "0.00",
      "row_count": 8
    }
  ],
  "total_amount": "180.00",
  "usage_amount": "150.00",
  "shared_amount": "30.00",
  "total_rows": 50
}
```

Tag dimensions appear in `dimensions` with the `tag:` prefix (e.g. `"tag:owner": "team-commerce"`). `usage_amount` is cost attributed by actual usage metrics. `shared_amount` is cost split evenly.

---

## Resources

### `GET /api/v1/tenants/{tenant_name}/resources`

List discovered resources. Paginated. Supports three temporal query modes:

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |

**Response:** `{"values": ["prod", "staging"]}`

### `POST /api/v1/tenants/{tenant_name}/tags/bulk`

Bulk create/update tags on explicit entity IDs.

**Body:**

```json
{
  "items": [
    {"entity_type": "resource", "entity_id": "cluster-1", "tag_key": "team", "tag_value": "platform"},
    {"entity_type": "identity", "entity_id": "sa-abc", "tag_key": "team", "tag_value": "data"}
  ],
  "created_by": "admin",
  "override_existing": false
}
```

**Response:** `{"created_count": 2, "updated_count": 0, "skipped_count": 0}`

When `override_existing` is true, existing tags with the same key are updated instead of skipped.

### `POST /api/v1/tenants/{tenant_name}/tags/bulk-by-filter`

Bulk tag all unique resources/identities found in chargebacks matching the given filters. Resolves entities server-side.

**Body:**

```json
{
  "start_date": "2026-01-01",
  "end_date": "2026-01-31",
  "timezone": "America/Denver",
  "identity_id": "sa-abc",
  "tag_key": "team",
  "display_name": "Platform",
  "created_by": "admin",
  "override_existing": false
}
```

`display_name` is stored as the tag value. `identity_id` narrows which chargebacks are scanned.

**Response:** `{"created_count": 2, "updated_count": 0, "skipped_count": 0}`

---

## Pipeline

### `POST /api/v1/tenants/{tenant_name}/pipeline/run`

Trigger a pipeline run for a tenant. Returns 202 (accepted).

Returns HTTP 409 if a run is already in progress. Requires `both` mode — API-only mode cannot trigger runs.

### `GET /api/v1/tenants/{tenant_name}/pipeline/status`

Get latest pipeline run status.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "tenant_name": "my-org",
  "is_running": false,
  "last_run": "2026-03-17T12:00:00Z",
  "last_result": {
    "dates_gathered": 5,
    "dates_calculated": 5,
    "chargeback_rows_written": 142,
    "errors": [],
    "completed_at": "2026-03-17T12:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

`last_result` is `null` if no completed or failed runs exist.

---

## Export

### `POST /api/v1/tenants/{tenant_name}/export`

Stream chargeback data as CSV. Returns `text/csv` with `Content-Disposition: attachment`.

**Body:**

```json
{
  "columns": ["timestamp", "resource_id", "product_type", "identity_id", "amount"],
  "start_date": "2026-01-01",
  "end_date": "2026-01-31",
  "timezone": "America/Denver",
  "filters": {
    "identity_id": "sa-12345",
    "product_type": "KAFKA_NUM_CKU"
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `columns` | list[string] | 9 default columns | Columns to include |
| `start_date` | date | no | Filter start |
| `end_date` | date | no | Filter end |
| `timezone` | string | no | IANA timezone for date boundaries (e.g. `America/Denver`). Defaults to UTC. |
| `filters` | dict | no | Key-value filters (`identity_id`, `product_type`, `resource_id`, `cost_type`) |

**All available columns:** `ecosystem`, `tenant_id`, `timestamp`, `resource_id`, `product_category`, `product_type`, `identity_id`, `cost_type`, `amount`, `allocation_method`, `allocation_detail`, `tags`, `metadata`.

The `tags` column is serialized as `key=value;key=value` pairs (e.g. `team=platform;env=prod`).

**Default columns:** `timestamp`, `resource_id`, `product_category`, `product_type`, `identity_id`, `cost_type`, `amount`, `allocation_method`, `tags`.

## FOCUS Mapping Preview

FOCUS Mapping Preview is an asynchronous, Confluent Cloud-only API under
`/api/v1/tenants/{tenant_name}/focus-preview`. Requested packages and monthly
revisions read persisted calculation and source evidence. Historical repair is
the only Preview operation that reacquires provider data and runs calculation.

The tenant must enable `focus_preview` for the requested interval. Disabled
tenants receive HTTP 409 `preview_commercial_profile_unavailable`; unrelated
billing, chargeback, and export endpoints remain available.

The API has no built-in authentication. Protect the complete Preview prefix with
an authenticated reverse proxy or API gateway. For configuration and UI/CLI
workflows, use [FOCUS Mapping Preview](focus-mapping-preview.md). This section
defines only the HTTP contract.

### `GET /api/v1/tenants/{tenant_name}/focus-preview/profile`

Return static capability metadata for `focus-1.4-preview-v1`:

- `mapping_profile_version`;
- `target_focus_version: "1.4"`;
- `conformance_status: "non_conforming"`;
- ordered `full_columns` and `summary_columns`; and
- ordered `known_gaps`, each containing `code`, `description`, and
  affected `columns`.

The current authority gaps are:

| Code | Description | Affected columns |
|---|---|---|
| `invoice_identity_unavailable` | Post-issuance invoice identity is unavailable. | `InvoiceDetailId`, `InvoiceId` |
| `provider_host_display_name_unavailable` | `HostProviderName` contains the raw provider cloud code, not a provider display name. | `HostProviderName` |
| `provider_region_display_name_unavailable` | Confluent inventory does not provide a distinct region display name. | `RegionName` |
| `derived_sku_identity_not_provider_authoritative` | SKU values are deterministic Chitragupta-derived evidence, not provider-issued identifiers. | `SkuId`, `SkuMeter`, `SkuPriceDetails`, `SkuPriceId`, `x_ChitraguptaSkuComponents` |

The endpoint validates tenant existence and the Confluent Cloud ecosystem but
does not initialize Preview storage or workers.

### `POST /api/v1/tenants/{tenant_name}/focus-preview/repairs`

Create an asynchronous historical repair. New repairs are accepted only in
`both` mode.

```json
{
  "start_date": "2026-01-01",
  "end_date": "2026-02-01"
}
```

Dates use inclusive-start/exclusive-end UTC semantics. The 1–364 date range must
fit inside the tenant's commercial, acquisition, cutoff, and retention
intervals and cannot include future dates.

A valid request returns HTTP 202, a `Location` header, and these operation
fields: `repair_id`, `tenant_name`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `status`,
`created_at`, nullable `started_at`, nullable `completed_at`, nullable
`diagnostic`, and date-ordered `dates`. Operation status is `queued`, `running`,
`completed`, `completed_with_failures`, or `failed`.

Each date contains `tracking_date`, `status`, and nullable `started_at`,
`completed_at`, `calculation_id`, `calculation_completed_at`, `rows_written`,
`failure_stage`, and `diagnostic`. Date status is `queued`, `running`,
`daily_validated`, `succeeded`, or `failed`. Failure stage is `retained_state`,
`provider_source`, `calculation`, `evidence`, `preview_validation`, or `worker`.
`daily_validated` is nonterminal: Daily validation passed, but validation of the
selected UTC month has not completed. Diagnostics contain `code`, `message`,
`retryable`, and optional `source_correlation_ids`.

Repair reacquires billing data and runs the ordinary calculation for the
selected tenant/date scope. It can replace billing, chargebacks, pipeline state,
source evidence, and allocation lineage in that range. It creates no requested
package or published revision.

Only one repair can be active per tenant. Process-wide repair admission uses
`preview.max_workers` and `preview.max_queued_repairs`. A rejected capacity
request creates no operation and is not retried automatically.

| Condition | Status | Detail |
|---|---:|---|
| Malformed, missing, or extra body field | 422 | FastAPI validation body |
| Unknown tenant | 404 | `Tenant '<tenant_name>' not found` |
| Unsupported ecosystem | 400 | `FOCUS Mapping Preview currently supports only Confluent Cloud tenants` |
| Disabled tenant | 409 | `preview_commercial_profile_unavailable` |
| Invalid or future range | 400 | `focus_preview_repair_range_invalid` or `focus_preview_repair_future_range` |
| Outside the eligible interval or over 364 dates | 400 | `focus_preview_repair_range_ineligible` |
| Worker unavailable | 503 | `FOCUS Mapping Preview repair worker is unavailable` |
| Storage unavailable | 503 | `FOCUS Mapping Preview repair storage is unavailable` |
| Repair already active | 409 | `focus_preview_repair_in_progress` |
| Tenant busy | 409 | `focus_preview_repair_tenant_busy` |
| Capacity full | 429 | `focus_preview_repair_capacity_exhausted` |

### `GET /api/v1/tenants/{tenant_name}/focus-preview/repairs/{repair_id}`

Return the same durable operation and complete per-date result list. GET is
available in `api` and `both` modes for an enabled tenant and does not require a
running repair worker. A missing repair or a repair owned by another tenant
returns 404. Disabled tenants retain the normal 409 enablement boundary.

### `POST /api/v1/tenants/{tenant_name}/focus-preview/requests`

Create a request. An admitted request returns HTTP 202 with a queued status
document. Capacity admission follows tenant, ecosystem, input, enablement, and
runtime validation.

The creation response requires `target_focus_version: "1.4"` and
`conformance_status: "non_conforming"`. The same fields remain present on every
subsequent request status/detail representation and recent-request list item.

```json
{
  "grain": "daily",
  "start_date": "2026-07-01",
  "end_date": "2026-08-01",
  "column_profile": "full"
}
```

Dates are UTC and use inclusive-start/exclusive-end semantics. The request must
contain 1–31 days within the UTC calendar month containing `start_date`; the
exclusive end may be the first day of the following month.

Monthly requests supply one exact ASCII `YYYY-MM`; public start/end dates are
not accepted for Monthly submission:

```json
{
  "grain": "monthly",
  "month": "2026-07",
  "column_profile": "summary"
}
```

`column_profile` defaults to `full`. Summary uses the fixed profile subset.
Custom supplies `columns`, for example
`{"column_profile":"custom","columns":["BilledCost","ResourceId"]}`.
Supported names retain first-occurrence caller order; unknown and duplicate
entries are logged and ignored. Full and Summary reject `columns`, and Custom
rejects a selection with no supported Full-profile columns.

When the process-local global or per-tenant capacity limit is full, the
submission returns HTTP 429:

```json
{
  "detail": {
    "code": "preview_capacity_exhausted",
    "message": "FOCUS Mapping Preview generation capacity is exhausted.",
    "retryable": true
  }
}
```

No request ID or artifacts are created for this response. Clients, including
`chitragupta-preview`, should wait and submit the request again; the CLI does
not automatically retry a capacity rejection.

### `GET /api/v1/tenants/{tenant_name}/focus-preview/requests`

Return recent requests newest first, including queued, running, ready, failed,
and expired requests. Ordering is descending by the immutable
`(created_at, request_id)` pair.

| Query | Default | Constraints | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `limit` | `20` | 1–100 | Maximum items returned. |
| `cursor` | none | Non-empty request ID | Continue after the prior page's `next_cursor`. |

The response is `{"items":[...],"next_cursor":"..."}`. Every item uses the
request representation, including required `target_focus_version: "1.4"` and
`conformance_status: "non_conforming"`. `next_cursor` is null when no later page
exists. A missing cursor and a cursor owned by another tenant both return 400
`Preview request cursor is invalid`.

### `GET /api/v1/tenants/{tenant_name}/focus-preview/requests/{request_id}`

Return a tenant-scoped request. Lifecycle is `queued`, `running`, then
`ready` or `failed`; a ready request becomes `expired` at its fixed cutoff.

The response fields are `request_id`, `tenant_name`, `target_focus_version`,
`conformance_status`, `grain`, `start_date`, `end_date`, nullable `month`,
`column_profile`, ordered `effective_columns`, `status`, `created_at`, nullable
`started_at`, nullable `completed_at`, nullable `expires_at`, nullable
`diagnostic`, nullable `source_snapshot`, and nullable `package`.

- Queued and running requests have no diagnostic, source snapshot, or package.
- Failed requests contain `{code, message, retryable}` and no package. Source
  failures may also contain `source_correlation_ids`: at most 20 sorted, unique,
  opaque `src:v1:<64 lowercase hex>` values.
- Ready requests contain source coverage and package download metadata.
- Expired requests retain their source snapshot and expiry but return
  `package: null`.

`source_snapshot` contains nullable `calculation_timestamp`, date-ordered
`calculation_coverage`, nullable `source_through`,
`effective_coverage_start_date`, `effective_coverage_end_date`, nullable
`evidence_through_date`, nullable `availability_cutoff_end_date`, and nullable
`monthly_status`. Each coverage entry contains `tracking_date`, `calculation_id`,
`calculation_completed_at`, and nullable `calculation_run_id`. `monthly_status`
is `provisional`, `settled`, or null.

A ready `package` contains `manifest`, ordered `files`, `download_all_name`, and
`download_all_url`. The files include the data parts and metadata file. Each
artifact includes `name`, `media_type`, `size_bytes`, `sha256`, optional `order`,
and `download_url`. Storage paths and keys are never returned.

For package files, lifecycle, manifest authority, and consumer handling, see
[Package contents and lifecycle](focus-mapping-preview.md#package-contents-and-lifecycle).

### `GET /api/v1/tenants/{tenant_name}/focus-preview/requests/{request_id}/manifest`

Return the exact stored `manifest.json` bytes for a ready request.

### `GET /api/v1/tenants/{tenant_name}/focus-preview/requests/{request_id}/files/{file_name}`

Return exact stored bytes for a file declared by a ready package. CSV files use
`text/csv`; `focus-metadata.json` uses `application/json`.

### `GET /api/v1/tenants/{tenant_name}/focus-preview/requests/{request_id}/archive`

Return `application/zip` named
`focus-mapping-preview-{request_id}.zip`. The ZIP contains the manifest
followed by its declared files.

Requested artifacts are available until `expires_at`, exactly seven days after
ready publication. Artifact endpoints return 410 after expiry. See
[Package contents and lifecycle](focus-mapping-preview.md#package-contents-and-lifecycle)
for the file and consumer contract.

### Published monthly revisions

Periodic workers publish validated Settled Monthly Full revisions. A later
material correction replaces the current revision; failed candidates leave it
unchanged. Consumers replace superseded revisions and never aggregate them.

Publication behavior and consumer handling are documented in
[Published monthly revisions](focus-mapping-preview.md#published-monthly-revisions).

#### `GET /api/v1/tenants/{tenant_name}/focus-preview/revisions/current`

Return the current published revision for required query `month=YYYY-MM`.
`revision_id` is optional on this metadata route and acts as a current-revision
guard when supplied.

The response contains revision identity and month bounds,
`target_focus_version: "1.4"`, `conformance_status: "non_conforming"`,
`monthly_status`, `published_at`, nullable `supersedes_revision_id`, nullable
`superseded_by_revision_id`, `lifecycle`, `material_sha256`, `source_snapshot`,
`validation`, `self_url`, and `package`.
The source snapshot reports calculation and source-through freshness, effective
coverage, evidence-through date, availability cutoff, and Monthly status. The
validation summary reports the mapping profile, source-record and output-row
counts, zero mapping errors, and passed artifact integrity. Package metadata
contains the manifest, ordered CSV files, final `focus-metadata.json`, and ZIP
download URL. Every returned
current-artifact URL includes both `month` and `revision_id`.

#### Current revision artifact endpoints

| Endpoint | Result |
|---|---|
| `GET /revisions/current/manifest?month=YYYY-MM&revision_id=...` | Exact validated `manifest.json` bytes. |
| `GET /revisions/current/files/{file_name}?month=YYYY-MM&revision_id=...` | Exact validated bytes for one declared CSV or metadata artifact. |
| `GET /revisions/current/archive?month=YYYY-MM&revision_id=...` | `application/zip` stream named `focus-mapping-preview-{month}-{revision_id}.zip`. |

The table paths are relative to the tenant Preview prefix. Artifact
`revision_id` is required. Each request re-reads the current revision before
delivery. If the guard no longer matches, the API returns:

```json
{
  "detail": {
    "code": "focus_preview_current_changed",
    "message": "The current FOCUS Mapping Preview revision changed; fetch the current revision and retry.",
    "retryable": true
  }
}
```

Clients should fetch metadata, follow its URLs, and repeat that sequence after
this 409 response.

#### `GET /api/v1/tenants/{tenant_name}/focus-preview/revisions`

List retained current and superseded revisions newest first for required query
`month=YYYY-MM`.

| Query | Default | Constraints | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `limit` | `20` | 1–100 | Maximum revisions returned. |
| `cursor` | none | Non-empty revision ID | Continue after the prior page's `next_cursor`. |

The response is `{"items":[...],"next_cursor":"...","replacement_semantics":"complete_replacement","consumer_action":"replace_do_not_aggregate"}`.
Each item contains the same target, conformance, lifecycle, freshness,
validation, and replacement fields as revision detail plus `detail_url`,
including required `target_focus_version: "1.4"` and
`conformance_status: "non_conforming"`. An unknown cursor, a cursor for a
different tenant/month, or a revision that is no longer publicly retained
returns 400 `FOCUS Mapping Preview revision cursor is invalid`.

#### `GET /api/v1/tenants/{tenant_name}/focus-preview/revisions/{revision_id}`

Return one publicly retained revision by immutable ID. Its manifest, individual
file, and archive URLs address that revision directly and do not use a
current-revision guard. A superseded revision therefore remains retrievable
until the billing-scope retention cutoff removes its month from public history.
The retained detail uses the same required `target_focus_version: "1.4"` and
`conformance_status: "non_conforming"` fields as current revision detail and
revision list items.

#### Retained revision artifact endpoints

| Endpoint | Result |
|---|---|
| `GET /revisions/{revision_id}/manifest` | Exact validated `manifest.json` bytes. |
| `GET /revisions/{revision_id}/files/{file_name}` | Exact validated bytes for one declared CSV or metadata artifact. |
| `GET /revisions/{revision_id}/archive` | `application/zip` stream named `focus-mapping-preview-{month}-{revision_id}.zip`. |

All revision list/detail responses state
`replacement_semantics: complete_replacement` and
`consumer_action: replace_do_not_aggregate`. Consumers must replace the prior
monthly revision; adding current and superseded revisions would double-count
the report.

| Condition | Status | Detail |
|---|---:|---|
| Missing required `month` or artifact `revision_id` | 422 | FastAPI missing-field response |
| Invalid or unrepresentable month | 400 | `month must use YYYY-MM` |
| No current revision for this tenant/month | 404 | `Current FOCUS Mapping Preview revision not found` |
| Unknown file on the matching current revision | 404 | `FOCUS Mapping Preview file not found for current revision` |
| Guard differs from the current revision | 409 | `focus_preview_current_changed` retry response shown above |
| Invalid or foreign revision-history cursor | 400 | `FOCUS Mapping Preview revision cursor is invalid` |
| Direct revision absent, foreign, or pending retention cleanup | 404 | `FOCUS Mapping Preview revision not found` |
| Unknown file on a direct revision | 404 | `FOCUS Mapping Preview file not found for revision` |
| Stored revision artifact is missing, corrupt, or inconsistent | 500 | `Stored FOCUS Mapping Preview revision artifact is unavailable` |
| Revision service is unavailable | 503 | `FOCUS Mapping Preview revision service is unavailable` |
| Revision storage is unavailable | 503 | `FOCUS Mapping Preview revision storage is unavailable` |

### Preview errors

| Condition | Status | Detail |
|---|---:|---|
| Invalid JSON, date, grain, or profile | 422 | FastAPI validation body |
| Unknown tenant | 404 | `Tenant '<tenant_name>' not found` |
| Non-Confluent Cloud tenant | 400 | `FOCUS Mapping Preview currently supports only Confluent Cloud tenants` |
| Tenant has no `focus_preview` block | 409 | `{"code":"preview_commercial_profile_unavailable","message":"An explicit Direct-billed PAYG profile does not cover the requested interval.","retryable":false}` |
| Start is not before end | 400 | `start_date must be before end_date` |
| Range crosses the allowed UTC month | 400 | `Daily preview range must stay within one UTC calendar month` |
| Invalid or unrepresentable Monthly value | 400 | `month must use YYYY-MM` |
| `columns` supplied for Full or Summary | 400 | `columns may be supplied only when column_profile is custom` |
| Custom has no supported columns | 400 | `Custom column selection must contain at least one supported Full-profile column` |
| Runtime unavailable | 503 | `FOCUS Mapping Preview runtime is unavailable` |
| Generation capacity exhausted | 429 | `{"code":"preview_capacity_exhausted","message":"FOCUS Mapping Preview generation capacity is exhausted.","retryable":true}` |
| Storage unavailable | 503 | `FOCUS Mapping Preview storage is unavailable` |
| Recovery unavailable | 503 | `FOCUS Mapping Preview recovery is unavailable` |
| Worker scheduling unavailable | 503 | `FOCUS Mapping Preview worker is unavailable` |
| Invalid or foreign recent-list cursor | 400 | `Preview request cursor is invalid` |
| Request absent or owned by another tenant | 404 | `Preview request '<request_id>' not found` |
| Manifest/file/archive requested before ready or after failure | 409 | Status-specific not-ready detail |
| Manifest/file/archive requested after expiry | 410 | `Preview request '<request_id>' expired at <UTC timestamp>` |
| File not enumerated by a ready package | 404 | File-specific not-found detail |
| Stored bytes unavailable | 500 | `Stored preview artifact is unavailable` |

The recovery 503 is retryable operationally after restoring tenant database
and artifact-root availability. Existing ready packages and revisions remain
available when their stored data can still be verified.

A generation whose temporary disk use would exceed
`preview.max_generation_spool_bytes` terminates as a failed request with
`diagnostic.code: preview_generation_spool_limit_exceeded`,
`diagnostic.message: FOCUS Mapping Preview package exceeds the configured
generation spool limit.`, and `retryable: false`. It publishes no package.
Scheduled publication logs the same diagnostic code, publishes no revision,
and leaves the current revision unchanged.

If `preview.max_csv_file_bytes` cannot fit the repeated header and one complete
row, generation fails with diagnostic code
`preview_csv_row_exceeds_file_size_limit`, message `A Preview CSV header or row
exceeds the configured file-size limit.`, and `retryable: false`. Increase the
part limit or set it to `null`; see
[Preview CSV part sizing](operations/troubleshooting.md#preview_csv_row_exceeds_file_size_limit).

Calculation diagnostics use these exact public meanings. Daily diagnostics
apply to the requested interval; Monthly diagnostics apply to the effective
evidence interval.

| Code | Retryable | Message |
|---|---:|---|
| `calculation_metadata_unavailable` | false | `One or more requested dates lack preview calculation metadata.` |
| `calculation_before_acquisition_lookback` | false | `Required retained calculation evidence is unavailable outside the current acquisition window.` |
| `calculation_pending_cutoff_window` | true | `One or more requested dates are still inside the configured acquisition cutoff window; wait for the dates to enter the acquisition window, run the pipeline, and retry.` |
| `calculation_unavailable` | true | `No successful persisted calculation is available for the requested dates; run the pipeline and retry.` |
| `calculation_coverage_incomplete` | true | `No successful persisted calculation covers every requested date; run the pipeline and retry.` |

Eligibility and source diagnostics are:

An ordinary nonblank line type that is not in the current mapping table does
not produce a failure diagnostic by itself. It maps to `Usage` /
`Usage-Based` when all other evidence is complete and valid. Recognized native
products reuse their current service mapping; unknown native products use the
FOCUS Other taxonomy with the exact native product as `ServiceName`. Existing
Support, promotional-credit, refund, correction, contradiction, malformed
record, provider-context, lineage, and reconciliation checks retain precedence.

| Code | Retryable | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `preview_commercial_profile_unavailable` | false | The optional tenant block is absent or its Direct-billed PAYG effective interval does not contain the request. |
| `preview_billing_currency_unsupported` | false | The configured or selected currency is not USD. Preview performs no currency conversion. |
| `preview_billing_currency_unknown` | false | Selected persisted aggregate currency evidence is blank. |
| `preview_source_record_malformed` | false | Persisted provider source evidence is malformed. |
| `preview_source_scope_unsupported` | false | Source evidence is not fully contained in the effective Daily or Monthly evidence interval. |
| `preview_charge_classification_ambiguous` | false | Credit/refund/adjustment/correction-like semantics are not authoritative. |
| `preview_source_line_type_unknown` | false | A source record has a missing or blank native line type. |
| `preview_source_mapping_unavailable` | false | A known line type lacks required mapping evidence, such as a returned unit for `KAFKA_STREAMS`. |
| `preview_source_record_incomplete` | false | Required Preview evidence is absent. |
| `preview_evidence_storage_unavailable` | false | Enabled Preview evidence storage or its schema is unavailable. Generic chargeback storage remains usable. |
| `preview_source_evidence_unavailable` | true | The newest persisted source-evidence attempt is unavailable or does not cover the requested interval. Run the pipeline and retry. |
| `preview_source_economics_unsupported` | false | Monetary or quantity values are outside the supported tracer. |
| `preview_source_reconciliation_failed` | false | Source, aggregate, or allocation evidence does not reconcile. |
| `preview_source_coverage_incomplete` | false | Complete source and aggregate origin coverage does not match. |
| `preview_mapping_scope_unsupported` | false | The complete source set exceeds the current Full-row mapping scope before profile projection, including multiple native/tier Cost rows associated with one billing origin. |
| `preview_allocation_lineage_incomplete` | false | Persisted calculation lineage is missing, incomplete, corrupt, or structurally inconsistent for one or more billing origins. |
| `preview_allocation_lineage_unavailable` | true | The ordinary calculation completed, but its Preview lineage capture or persistence did not. Run the pipeline and retry. |
| `preview_billing_account_unavailable` | false | No authoritative persisted Confluent organization binding is available. |
| `preview_billing_account_conflicting` | false | Persisted Confluent organization evidence conflicts for the tenant partition. |
| `preview_provider_context_incomplete` | false | Authoritative resource context is absent or incompatible; all TABLEFLOW rows use this failure because current inventory cannot prove their provider context. |
| `preview_mapping_validation_failed` | false | A generated Daily Full row or Monthly Full aggregate does not satisfy the current Full-row mapping profile before Full/Summary/Custom projection. |

Fallback-mapped line types still use persisted allocation results; Preview does
not recalculate them. Missing lineage returns
`preview_allocation_lineage_incomplete`, and reconciliation differences return
`preview_source_reconciliation_failed`. These failures expose no package.

`lookback_days` defines acquisition eligibility, not retention or guaranteed
reconstruction. Use historical repair only while the required provider and
metrics history remains available.

## Topic Attributions

Topic attribution rows are produced by the optional `topic_overlay` pipeline
stage (Confluent Cloud only). Each row represents the cost portion attributed to
one topic for one billing line item. Requires `topic_attribution.enabled: true`
in plugin settings. For a two-period ranked comparison, use the
[`topic-attributions` comparison endpoint](#compare-two-cost-periods).

### `GET /api/v1/tenants/{tenant_name}/topic-attributions`

List topic attribution rows. Paginated.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `start_date` | date | no | Filter start |
| `end_date` | date | no | Filter end |
| `timezone` | string | no | IANA timezone for date boundaries. Defaults to UTC. |
| `cluster_resource_id` | string | no | Filter by cluster (e.g. `lkc-abc123`) |
| `topic_name` | string | no | Filter by topic name |
| `product_type` | string | no | Filter by product type |
| `attribution_method` | string | no | Filter by method (`bytes_ratio`, `retained_bytes_ratio`, `even_split`) |
| `tag_key` | string | no | Filter by tag key (exact match) |
| `tag_value` | string | no | Filter by tag value (requires tag_key, exact match) |
| `page` | int | no | Page number (default 1) |
| `page_size` | int | no | Page size 1–1000 (default 100) |

**Response fields per item:** `dimension_id`, `ecosystem`, `tenant_id`, `timestamp`, `env_id`, `cluster_resource_id`, `topic_name`, `product_category`, `product_type`, `attribution_method`, `amount`.

### `GET /api/v1/tenants/{tenant_name}/topic-attributions/aggregate`

Multi-dimensional aggregation of topic attribution rows.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `group_by` | list[string] | `["topic_name"]` | Columns or tag keys to group by (repeatable). Use `tag:{key}` for tag-based grouping. |
| `time_bucket` | string | `day` | `hour`, `day`, `week`, or `month` |
| `start_date` | date | no | Filter start |
| `end_date` | date | no | Filter end |
| `timezone` | string | no | IANA timezone for date boundaries. Defaults to UTC. |
| `cluster_resource_id` | string | no | Filter by cluster |
| `topic_name` | string | no | Filter by topic |
| `product_type` | string | no | Filter by product type |
| `tag:{key}` | string | no | Filter to rows where the tag `{key}` matches the given value. Repeatable for AND semantics. Comma-separated values in a single param are OR-matched. |

**Valid `group_by` columns:** `topic_name`, `cluster_resource_id`, `env_id`, `product_type`, `product_category`, `attribution_method`. Invalid dimension names are silently dropped (no 400).

**Tag-based grouping (`group_by=tag:{key}`):**

Use `tag:` prefix to group by a resource tag key instead of a dimension column. Examples:

- `group_by=tag:owner` — group by the `owner` tag; rows with no `owner` tag land in an `UNTAGGED` bucket.
- `group_by=tag:owner&group_by=tag:department` — group by two tag keys; each bucket has both keys in `dimensions`.
- `group_by=tag:owner&group_by=topic_name` — mix tag and dimension grouping in one query.

Topic attribution is resource-only — tags are resolved from the resource entity (`cluster_resource_id:topic:topic_name`) only. There is no identity join and no resource/identity precedence rule.

**Tag-based filtering (`tag:{key}={value}`):**

Dynamic query parameters prefixed `tag:` are treated as tag filters and are independent of `group_by`.

- `tag:department=eng` — only rows where the resource's `department` tag equals `eng`.
- `tag:team=platform,commerce` — `team` IN (`platform`, `commerce`) — comma-separated values are OR-matched within one key.
- `tag:owner=alice&tag:department=eng` — multiple tag params are AND-matched across keys.
- Untagged rows (no matching tag key on the resource) are excluded from filtered results.

Tag key format: must start with an alphanumeric character, then alphanumeric, `_`, or `-`, up to 63 characters total. Invalid keys return HTTP 400.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "buckets": [
    {
      "dimensions": {"tag:owner": "alice", "topic_name": "payments-events"},
      "time_bucket": "2026-01-01",
      "total_amount": "10.00",
      "row_count": 1
    },
    {
      "dimensions": {"tag:owner": "UNTAGGED", "topic_name": "untagged-events"},
      "time_bucket": "2026-01-01",
      "total_amount": "25.00",
      "row_count": 1
    }
  ],
  "total_amount": "35.00",
  "total_rows": 2
}
```

Tag dimensions appear in `dimensions` with the `tag:` prefix (e.g. `"tag:owner": "alice"`). Rows with no matching tag appear under `"UNTAGGED"`.

### `GET /api/v1/tenants/{tenant_name}/topic-attributions/dates`

List distinct dates for which topic attribution rows exist.

**Response:** `{"dates": ["2026-01-01", "2026-01-02", ...]}`

### `POST /api/v1/tenants/{tenant_name}/topic-attributions/export`

`Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=topic_attributions.csv`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `start_date` | date | no | Filter start |
| `end_date` | date | no | Filter end |
| `timezone` | string | no | IANA timezone for date boundaries. Defaults to UTC. |

**CSV columns:** `ecosystem`, `tenant_id`, `timestamp`, `env_id`, `cluster_resource_id`, `topic_name`, `product_category`, `product_type`, `attribution_method`, `amount`.

## Graph

Returns cost topology as a graph (nodes + edges) for use by the cost explorer graph frontend. One endpoint covers three views depending on the `focus` parameter.

### `GET /api/v1/tenants/{tenant_name}/graph`

Return a neighborhood of nodes and directed edges centred on a focus entity.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `focus` | string | — | Entity ID to focus on. Omit for root (tenant) view. |
| `depth` | int | 1 | Hierarchy hops from focus (1–3). |
| `at` | datetime | now | Point-in-time lifecycle filter (ISO 8601 with timezone, e.g. `2026-03-15T00:00:00Z`). |
| `start_date` | date | — | Cost period start date. Overrides `at`-derived month when provided. |
| `end_date` | date | — | Cost period end date. Overrides `at`-derived month when provided. |
| `timezone` | string | UTC | IANA timezone for `start_date`/`end_date` boundaries. |

**Views:**

- **Root view** (`focus` omitted): returns a synthetic tenant node plus one environment node per active environment. Edges are `parent` type, directed tenant → environment.
- **Environment focus** (`focus=env-abc`): returns the environment node plus all direct child resources up to `depth` hops (clusters, connectors, flink pools, schema registries). Edges are `parent` type, directed parent → child.
- **Cluster focus** (`focus=lkc-abc`): returns the cluster node, its child topic nodes, and any identity (service account / pool) nodes charged to the cluster via chargeback. Edges are `parent` (cluster → topic) and `charge` (cluster → identity).

**Billing period:** when `start_date`/`end_date` are omitted, the cost window defaults to the full calendar month containing `at` (e.g. `at=2026-03-15` → March 1–April 1).

**Response:** `GraphResponse`
